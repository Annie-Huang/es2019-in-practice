# refactoring-es2019

> Refactoring to ES2019

In this course, we'll learn how to use the new features available in the latest version of javascript, commonly referred
to as ES2019. ES2019's features are fully available in the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Node,
and are also available via compilation with Babel or Typescript. ES2019 is a relatively small update the language compared
to previous years, but still contains useful features and miscellaneous fixes to the language to be aware of. A new version
of javascript comes out ever year, and staying up to date with the language is important as you'll be more likely to encounter
new syntax and features as time goes on, allowing you to stay productive in any javascript codebase.

We'll explore ES2019 from within an existing Nuxt.js application, and explore real world use cases and opportunities to use ES2019's
new features, typically allowing us to replace 3rd party libraries or self written functions with new built in behavior:

* Object.fromEntries
* Symbol.prototype.description
* Array.prototype.flatMap
* Array.prototype.flat
* String.prototype.trimStart
* String.prototype.trimEnd
* Array Stable Sorting
* Optional Catch binding


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```
